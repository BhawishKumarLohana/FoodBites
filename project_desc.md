## Inspiration

In **Hong Kong and around the world**, as income disparity increases, we find ourselves in a world where many families struggle to afford daily meals — while **tons of edible food are discarded** by restaurants and households into landfills every day.

We've seen this imbalance firsthand. We are a team of **international students in Hong Kong**, and we've witnessed situations where **perfectly good food is thrown away**, while many on the streets cry for just a bowl of rice.

This reality inspired us to build **FoodBites** which **bridges the gap** by enabling NGOs to efficiently connect with donors and restaurants to **redistribute surplus food** to those who need it most.

## What it does
**FoodBites** is a simple yet powerful solution to the costly and inefficient problem of food distribution.

Our platform allows **individual donors, NGOs, and restaurants** to seamlessly:

- **List surplus food for donation**
- **Claim available food with ease**
- **Visualize nearby donors through an interactive map**

By connecting supply and demand in real time, FoodBites creates an efficient ecosystem where **minimizing food waste & time** and **maximizing impact** is the only focus.

## How we built it

This is a **Full Stack Web Application** built using:

- **Next.js** for the frontend and routing
- **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive styling
- **MySQL** with **Prisma ORM** for backend database operations
- **Google Maps API** for geolocation and address-based visualizations

We use geospatial data to **dynamically locate donors and recipients**, helping us deliver **optimized and location-aware results** for efficient food distribution.

## Challenges we ran into

- **Database Design**  
  Designing an optimized and efficient schema was a major challenge. We took time to eliminate redundancy and ensure the structure supports performance and scalability, all while keeping it flexible enough to support multiple user types and relationships.

- **Time Constraints**  
  Our idea was ambitious. it required thoughtful planning, smart logic, and end-to-end implementation. Balancing all of that within a limited timeframe was tough, but rewarding. The complexity wasn’t just in building—it was in thinking through the ecosystem.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We’re proud that with minimal experience and limited time we built a **fully functional full stack application** that leverages modern web technologies, best practices, and thoughtful design. This wasn’t just a coding exercise. We planned everything end-to-end: from **database schema and APIs ** to **user experience and deployment**.

Our project also aligns with several **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**:

** SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**: By enabling efficient food donation and redistribution, we reduce food insecurity and support those in need.
- ** SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production**: We combat food waste by connecting donors with NGOs and recipients in real-time.
- ** SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals**: Our platform fosters collaboration among individuals, restaurants, and NGOs to create a more sustainable and equitable system.

## What we learned

For our entire team, this was our **first-ever hackathon** and the **fastest project** we've ever built together or individually.

## What's next for FoodBites

Making it live & alive. Our goal is to make it production ready.
